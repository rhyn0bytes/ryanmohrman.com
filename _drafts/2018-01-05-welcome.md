# Welcome, welcome, welcome!

This new blog and personal site will be used as a way for me to post my thoughts about many things that interest me. 

The main focus will be products and my experience interacting with them, but you may find me posting about music, brewing or one of the many fun things we have to do outdoors. I have set a personal goal to update this blog each Friday of the year 
so please come back and check in from time to time.

## Brew-tastic!

For my welcome post I want to introduce you to one of my passions; Brewing beer! 
Every year I plan a trip called **Beercation** that focuses on craft breweries in given area. While I'm writing this introductory post, I have just finished a quick trip 
to Rhinegheist in Cincinnati, OH and I would like to share my excitement.

Established in a historic bottling plant from 1895, this awesome space has a rich backstory tying the current brewery to the Over-the-Rhine community. Not only are the beers all great (I had plenty of samples from different styles), but the atmosphere of standing in an old concrete bottling plant is pretty spectacular.

What this brewery really says to me is, "we are the definition of craft brewing." 
Not to lay on the thick cheese, but to me, craft brewing is all about sharing how beer can bring people together (it's about community). The founders of Rhinegeist put this out in front of their brewery and it feels almost like a scrappy, DIY 
brewery on a larger scale. I'll have more thoughts on craft beer and this brewery in particular in later posts, but for now, find yourself a delicious beer and think about how cool it is that you're drinking some science!

**Prost!**
