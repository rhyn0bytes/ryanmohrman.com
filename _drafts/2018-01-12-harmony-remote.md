## What is going on here?!?

Technology can be frustrating for anyone. Especially when a product isn't cleanly 
set up or supported or when the requirements of using a product were seemingly made 
without regard to a bigger picture. This past Christmas I bought myself a new toy 
so that I would be able to control the living room entertainment center from my phone 
(and eventually directly from Google home with voice only), but I was not prepared 
for the amount of work that would be needed to configure and connect all the devices 
together.

Overall, the unpacking and initial setup was uneventful until attempting to connect the harmony hub to my network. The first, undocumented restriction came in the form of special characters not being supported in the wifi password stored on the hub. 
This meant that my secure password would need to only use letters and numbers now. 
After this discovery, I was still not able to connect the hub because of the second, 
undocumented restriction on the password length... I'm not happy about this experience so far, but I'm still determined to get everything set up.

## 2 Hours Later...

Finally! I figured out those two missing password requirements and have the hub connected to the network. Now we wait for the firmware to update... Reading through some Logitech community posts about linking Harmony to Google home, I begin to question how this section of my install will go. 

Not well. Not well at all. Every attempt to link my Harmony hub to Google results in a 15-20 minute timeout with no error log to read through. It turns out that I might have a version issue with Chrome (which is hard to test since I cannot control the version of Chrome being used by the Google Home app). I try the obvious things:
- connect harmony and google from my laptop
- update my google home app
- uninstall and reinstall my app
- grab an older version of google chrome
- restore an old android device and try with that one
- curse the air in my last ditch hopes that my devices will take pity on me

The usual tech support checklist.

Since none of the above appear to work, I will resolve myself to enjoy the portion that is working.

## The Final Outcome

While I still haven't connected Harmony to my Google Home account, I can control all of my devices from my phone and a single remote! One big step closer to making my apartment feel more like a smart home.
