This week I installed [VoiceMeter Banana](https://www.vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/banana.htm){:target="_blank"} 
and I couldn't be happier with the results. I can now have 3 separate inputs for capturing audio. Currently, I am using 2, my headset microphone and my webcam. The VoiceMeter UI 
allows me to independently adjust the levels, audio settings and volumes for my inputs and my applications will not care which I am using. This allows me to effectively turn off the windows audio management and leaves the controls in my hands.

I have split my audio outputs into two streams also. One is targeting my main computer audio (games, music, system sounds) and the other is for communication programs. What 
I have found here is that I can change the volume of voice chat without changing the volume of the main computer sounds. This is great for gaming where you want to keep your teams VOIP volume higher than the game sounds.

I will write more information on this application and my setup in general in an update or another post.
