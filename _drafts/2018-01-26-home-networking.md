**Wow**  This was more research intensive than originally planned.

## The Problem

Pushing close to 100 individual devices connected to a home network can cause some 
serious headaches. While nearly all of these are connected wirelessly, heavy network 
use items like desktop computers, media servers and gaming systems need wired connections.

Here is the prioritization I was thinking when I sarted this upgrade:
1. Gaming and Streaming devices
2. Wireless devices focused on communication (voice, video, screen sharing)
3. Home automation devices
4. Lower use projects (Raspberry Pi, Arduino, etc)

To add to the porblem with home networking, I currently live in an apartment with approximately 10 additional networks potentially interfering with my devices. I also cannot make major or perminant changes to the apartment in order to run cable cleanly.

## The Solution

When I want to get cables (any cables), I will always go to [Monoprice](https://www.monoprice.com/){:target="_blank"}! I bought nearly 1000 feet total of cat 6 cable, and a 5-port gigabit switch for each room. 
My router can have 4 cables wired which eneded up being used for each main room (1 per bedroom and 1 for master), the master cable is connected to a switch
